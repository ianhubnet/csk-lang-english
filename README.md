# 🇺🇸 CSK Core Language Files — English

This repository contains the **default English language pack** for [CodeIgniter Skeleton (CSK)](https://github.com/ianhubnet).

CSK uses a modular translation system, where each language is maintained as an independent package for easier updates and community contributions.

## 📦 Contents

* All default language files used by the CSK Core and Admin Interface.
* Organized following CodeIgniter's `/language/english/` structure.
* Acts as the **reference base** for all other translations.

## Structure

Each CSK translation must follow the naming convention `csk-lang-<language>` and contain standard CodeIgniter files inside `language/<language>/ci3/` and CSK files inside `language/<language>/`. Admin files should be put inside `language/<languages>/admin/`.

## Contribution
If you want to translate CSK into another language:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Rename it to follow `csk-lang-<yourlanguage>`.
3. Add your translations.
4. Push to your own repo — CSK automation will take care of the rest.

> ⚙️ CSK automatically detects new translations and adds them to the [csk-languages](https://github.com/ianhubnet/csk-languages) hub.
